## These Tools...

The following tools discussed are very important to me, for they provide help to me; allowing me to program and go through this course without too much struggle. Further, they allow me to work hard in class and be an efficient learner, as I do not have to deal with any sorts of struggles.

**In the Development process, developers use Version control. Annotate in notes what you have learned about Version Control while doing this setup process**

- Where are the files from GitHub placed on your local machine. How do you navigate to those files

After using "git clone," the file is placed in a directory named after the repository. The "cd" cmd can be used from the directory these are located in order to navigate to that directory. 

- Where are the files placed in the GitHub Cloud, how do you navigate to those files

These files are stored in the GitHub Cloud Servers, in which they can be navigated to via the url of the repository URL.

- How would you update your Template or Fork of student repository if teacher wanted you to pick up an update?

On GitHub, the fork can be synced via the upstream repository. Another way is to add the original repository as a remote "upstream," in which the changes can be fetched after. After, from the local branch, these changes can be fetched and merged.

- Put into words the difference between viewing GitHub Pages running on localhost machine versus running on a deployed server

The local host server is a site that is locally on my computer and can only be accessed through my computer. A deployed server is run on GitHub and can be accessed via the internet.

- What is the localhost URL for your distribution? Can anyone else see it?

Typically, the localhost URL for my distribution is "http://localhost:4000/" nobody but the machine owner can see it.

- What is the GitHub Pages URL for your distribution? Can anyone else see it?

The GitHub URL of my repository is "http://ethan.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/" it is public.
