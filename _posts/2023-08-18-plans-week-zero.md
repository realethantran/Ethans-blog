Starting next week, I want to pick up the pace and begin to code as I think this week was a bit slowed down. Looking ahead, there are hacks for the Java Hello and Linux Installation blogs that I will start on.

Finished:

- Tools and Equipment Overview
- VSCode, GitHub Pages Setup
- Build a Student Page
- Anatomy of GitHub Pages
- Grab a Project

Looking Ahead:

- Java Hello
- Java Console Games
- Linux Shell and Bash
- Fix code output format
