    "You will write a class Textbook, which is a subclass of Book.\n",
    "A Textbook has an edition number, which is a positive integer used to identify different versions of the book. The getBookInfo method, when callsed on a Textbook, returns a string that also includes the edition information, as shown in the example.\n",
    "Information about the book title and price must be maintained in the Book class. Information about the edition must be maintained in the Textbook class.\n",
    "The Textbook class contains an additional method, canSubstituteFor, which returns true if a Textbook is a valid substitue for another Textbook and returns false otherwise. The current Textbook is a valid substitute for the Textbook referenced by the parameter of the canSubstituteFor method if the two Textbook objects have the same title and if the edition of the current Textbook is greater than or equal to the edition of the parameter."
