| 0    | Tools and Software Development Processes | [Week 0 Hacks](https://github.com/realethantran/ethan_student/issues/1)       | [First Blog](https://ethan.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/c1.4/2023/08/20/First-Blog.html), [Tools and Equipment](https://ethan.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/2023/08/20/tools-equipment-hacks.html) | This week was a lot of setup, Tay and I were able to help each other out (I helped with setting up the website and Tay helped me with installing Java). Overall, this week had a lot of focus on personalizing our websites and making sure everything worked as they should. | Starting next week, I want to pick up the pace and begin to code as I think this week was a bit slowed down. Looking ahead, there are hacks for the Java Hello and Linux Installation blogs that I will start on. |

Reviewing the blogs on the AP CSA website, I tested and checked out the featured Java demos to prepare for the coming weeks.                                                                                                                             | Next week, I see that there is more Java coding such as the console games. I have already taken a look at the provided code and will try to start this weekend. |
